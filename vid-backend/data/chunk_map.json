Based \non the navigation links provided within the staff directory, a substantial number of \nfaculty members are associated with the university, as indicated by the presence of 23 \npages listing staff.1 This large academic body suggests a significant capacity for \ninstruction and research across a diverse range of fields.

  "ce for individuals seeking to understand the academic and research strengths \ninherent within PES University's faculty. \n2. Methodology \nThe primary source of data for this report is the PES University Staff A-Z directory, \naccessible through the URL provided.1 The methodology employed involves a \nsystematic examination of each page within this directory to identify all listed faculty \nmembers and the designations attributed to them.
